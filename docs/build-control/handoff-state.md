# Handoff State — Guided AI Labs Agentic OS CNS

**Last Updated:** 2026-06-26 (session 4 — compaction-first loop protocol)
**Owner:** Build Agent Orchestrator

This file is the restart point for any agent, session, or context reset. Read this first after a compaction, clear, or handoff.

## Loop State

active: false
last_completed_task: "0.7f"
next_task: "Phase 1 (windows-local) — awaiting Adam CP-0 confirmation"
skipped_tasks: []
compaction_count: 6
paused: true
pause_reason: "CP-0 GATE REACHED 2026-06-26 — all 11 Phase 0 tasks (0.2-0.7f) are ready-for-review across 9 repos. Loop paused per stop condition; do NOT start Phase 1 (windows-local) without Adam's confirmation + PR merges. Two review flags: (1) PR #2/task 0.5 A-level descriptions elaborated (confirm); (2) cross-repo UAOS->GAIL OS rename pass recommended post-CP-0."

---

## Where We Are

**Phase:** Phase 0 — cloud agent runs in progress
**Status:** Cloud agent infrastructure complete. Phase 0 tasks 0.2–0.7f ready to run (all cloud-safe). Phase 1 chunk specs written but require Windows-local execution.
**Immediate next (cloud agents):** Pick up any `available` task from `docs/build-control/cloud-dispatch.yaml`. Read `docs/cloud-agent-startup.md` first.
**Immediate next (Windows/local):** After CP-0 — begin Chunk 20 in GAIL OS Rev 2. See `docs/build-control/2026-06-25 - phase-1-chunk-specs.md`.

### 2026-06-26 — Session transition: terminal → VS Code

Terminal `/loop` session is closing. **The VS Code session continues from here.**

- **State at handoff:** CP-0 gate reached — all 11 Phase 0 tasks (0.2–0.7f) are `ready-for-review`; 11 PRs open across 9 repos awaiting Adam's review/merge. Loop is paused (`paused: true`); Phase 1 is `windows-local` and must not start without Adam's confirmation.
- **Resume point for VS Code:** read this Loop State block + `cloud-dispatch.yaml`. Two open flags for Adam: (1) PR #2/task 0.5 A-level descriptions (confirm or trim to names-only); (2) cross-repo UAOS→GAIL OS rename pass recommended post-CP-0.
- **Note:** `docs/loop-protocol.md` was updated (commit `bb14461`) so control-repo *tasks* use branch+PR, not direct `main`. This entry is a continuity housekeeping note (not a task), committed to `main` so the next session sees it.

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Task 0.7f + CP-0 GATE

1. **Task 0.7f executed** in `Adamgdwn/guided-ai-labs-website`: prepended CNS Role section to AGENTS.md (Front door + commercial signal layer; events inquiry.created/demo_requested/lead.qualified; CP-1 prerequisite). 20 additions / 0 deletions. **PR #1 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/guided-ai-labs-website/pull/1.
2. **CP-0 GATE REACHED — all 11 Phase 0 PRs open (ready-for-review):**
   - 0.2 the-freedom-engine-os#21 · 0.3 gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2#1 · 0.4 graphify-workspace-cockpit#1 · 0.5 gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2#2 · 0.6 ag-operations-m365-foundation#2 · 0.7a guided-ai-journey-website-and-tools#4 · 0.7b oldskoolai.com#1 · 0.7c bowtie_risk_program#5 · 0.7d change-leadership-tools#2 · 0.7e clean-pdf-build#6 · 0.7f guided-ai-labs-website#1
3. **Loop PAUSED at CP-0** per stop condition. Phase 1 tasks are windows-local (require Windows/CI test validation) — do NOT start without Adam's confirmation + merges.
4. **Two flags for Adam:** (a) PR #2/0.5 A-level descriptions elaborated beyond names-only — confirm or trim; (b) cross-repo UAOS→GAIL OS rename pass recommended (drift in Graphify vision.md + M365 stage docs).

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.7e (clean-pdf-build CNS role)

1. **Private repo access verified** (read probe). Claimed + executed task 0.7e in `Adamgdwn/clean-pdf-build` (EasyDraft Docs).
   - Inserted CNS Role section into AGENTS.md (Document-production motor circuit; events document.generated/document.evidence_attached; CP-1 prerequisite). Verified 20 additions / 0 deletions.
   - **PR #6 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/clean-pdf-build/pull/6 (`ready-for-review`).
2. **Dispatch updated** — 0.7e → `ready-for-review`. **10 of 11 Phase 0 tasks done.** Next: 0.7f (guided-ai-labs-website) — the LAST Phase 0 task. After 0.7f → CP-0 stop condition: pause and surface all Phase 0 PRs for Adam.

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.7d (change-leadership-tools CNS role)

1. **Private repo access verified** via read probe (authenticated as Adamgdwn, repo owner) — not blocked. Claimed + executed task 0.7d.
   - Prepended CNS Role section to AGENTS.md (after managed nextjs-agent-rules block): Adoption + organizational change circuit; events stakeholder.engagement_recorded/adoption.milestone_reached; CP-1 prerequisite. Verified 20 additions / 0 deletions.
   - **PR #2 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/change-leadership-tools/pull/2 (`ready-for-review`).
2. **Dispatch updated** — 0.7d → `ready-for-review`. Next: 0.7e (clean-pdf-build — PRIVATE; verify access).

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.7c (bowtie_risk_program CNS role)

1. **Claimed + executed task 0.7c** in `Adamgdwn/bowtie_risk_program`; repo had no AGENTS.md → created fresh AGENTS.md (Risk + control modelling circuit; events risk.identified/control.applied/risk_program.updated; CP-1 prerequisite).
   - **PR #5 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/bowtie_risk_program/pull/5 (`ready-for-review`).
2. **Dispatch updated** — 0.7c → `ready-for-review`. Next: 0.7d (change-leadership-tools — PRIVATE, verify token scope; [BLOCKED] path if denied).
3. **7 of 11 Phase 0 tasks done** (0.2-0.6, 0.7a-0.7c). Remaining: 0.7d(private), 0.7e(private), 0.7f.

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.7b (oldskoolai.com CNS role)

1. **Resumed from pause** (Adam re-ran /loop); claimed + executed task 0.7b in `Adamgdwn/oldskoolai.com`.
   - Branch created first (per 0.7a lesson), then prepended CNS Role section to existing AGENTS.md (Learning + capability signal layer; events lesson.completed/role_path.selected/capability.signal_emitted; CP-1 prerequisite).
   - **PR #1 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/oldskoolai.com/pull/1 (`ready-for-review`).
2. **Dispatch updated** — 0.7b → `ready-for-review`. Next: 0.7c (bowtie_risk_program).

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.7a (GAI Journey CNS role)

1. **Claimed + executed task 0.7a** in `Adamgdwn/guided-ai-journey-website-and-tools` via GitHub MCP.
   - AGENTS.md existed (large, ~280 lines) → prepended CNS Role section (Diagnostic sensory + readiness pathway circuit; Phase 5 events readiness.completed/pilot_candidate.created/inquiry.created; CP-1 prerequisite).
   - Integrity verified via commit diff: **20 additions, 0 deletions** (clean prepend).
   - **PR #4 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/guided-ai-journey-website-and-tools/pull/4 (`ready-for-review`).
2. **Process note:** initial write 404'd because the branch wasn't created first — fixed by creating the branch, then re-writing. Reminder for 0.7b–0.7f: create branch BEFORE composing large file writes.
3. **Dispatch updated** — 0.7a → `ready-for-review`. Next: 0.7b (oldskoolai.com).

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.6 (M365 framing)

1. **Claimed + executed task 0.6** in `Adamgdwn/ag-operations-m365-foundation` via GitHub MCP.
   - Repo had no AGENTS.md → created `AGENTS.md` with CNS role block (first-class enterprise body; no unregistered write paths; BLK-005; lean startup; secret handling).
   - Stage 9 doc (`M365_STAGE_9_AGENTIC_OS_BRIDGE_READINESS.md`) verified consistent (governed business substrate, purpose-built agentic bridge).
   - **PR #2 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/ag-operations-m365-foundation/pull/2 (`ready-for-review`).
2. **Dispatch updated** — 0.6 → `ready-for-review`. Next: 0.7a.

> **⚠️ CROSS-REPO ISSUE FOR ADAM — UAOS→GAIL OS naming drift.** Legacy "UAOS / User AI
> Operating System" naming for the execution layer (superseded by GAIL OS Rev 2 on
> 2026-06-21) persists across repos: found in `graphify-workspace-cockpit/docs/vision.md`
> (task 0.4, partially corrected) and `ag-operations-m365-foundation` Stage 9 +
> `M365_GRAPHIFY_UAOS_ALIGNMENT.md` (task 0.6, flagged via AGENTS.md note). This is broader
> than any single Tiny task. **Recommend scheduling a dedicated cross-repo UAOS→GAIL OS
> rename pass** as a follow-up work item after CP-0. Not blocking Phase 0.

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.5 (authority ladders)

1. **Resumed from checkpoint** (compaction_count 2); claimed + executed task 0.5 in `Adamgdwn/gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2` via GitHub MCP.
   - Branch `cloud/0.5-authority-ladders` created; new file `docs/governance/authority-ladders.md` written (R0-R5 verbatim, A0-A6 table, action state machine, A6 future-state note, source-of-truth attribution).
   - **PR #2 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2/pull/2 (status `ready-for-review`).
2. **Flagged for Adam:** master-plan §4 gives A-levels as names only; A-level *descriptions* in the new table are minimal elaborations (names verbatim) — noted in PR for confirmation.
3. **Dispatch updated** — 0.5 → `ready-for-review`, pr_url set. Next: 0.6 (M365 Foundation — first-class enterprise body framing; likely create AGENTS.md).

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.4 (Graphify framing)

1. **Resumed from checkpoint** after compaction refresh (compaction_count 1); claimed + executed task 0.4 against `Adamgdwn/graphify-workspace-cockpit` via GitHub MCP.
   - Branch `cloud/0.4-graphify-framing` created.
   - `AGENTS.md` verified canonical (connectome / relationship-intelligence) — no change.
   - `README.md` verified not visualization-only (decision cockpit) — no change; left public OSS readme clean.
   - `docs/vision.md` — added "Role in the Guided AI Labs CNS" section; **resolved framing conflict**: Layer-3 "UAOS" → GAIL OS (superseded 2026-06-21), with dated naming note; mapped internal layering to CNS triad.
   - **PR #1 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/graphify-workspace-cockpit/pull/1 (status `ready-for-review`).
2. **Follow-up flagged:** full UAOS→GAIL OS rename across cockpit's other /docs (integration-guide.md, specs) deferred — out of scope for Tiny task.
3. **Dispatch updated** — 0.4 → `ready-for-review`, pr_url set. Next: 0.5 (GAIL OS authority-ladders doc).

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.3 (GAIL OS framing)

1. **Task 0.3 claimed + executed** against `Adamgdwn/gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2` via GitHub MCP (claim commit pushed before work).
   - Branch `cloud/0.3-gailos-framing` created.
   - Repo-wide code search for `hand brake` / `handbrake` / `guardian` / `limiter` / `restricts Freedom` → **0 hits**. No restraint framing to replace.
   - `AGENTS.md` — added explicit "Enabler, not a hand brake" statement to CNS Role (governance-as-enabler per non-negotiable rule 9); header refreshed to 2026-06-26.
   - `README.md` verified clean ("governed technical spine"); no change.
   - **PR #1 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2/pull/1 (status `ready-for-review`).
2. **Dispatch updated** — 0.3 → `ready-for-review`, pr_url set.
3. **Context refresh:** context heavy after two full tasks → ScheduleWakeup(60s) to refresh before task 0.4 (Graphify framing). compaction_count → 1.

### 2026-06-26 Session 5 — Loop run: Task 0.2 (Freedom framing)

1. **Loop started** (`/loop coordinate CNS build`) — claimed task 0.2 per loop-protocol atomic claim lock (commit `e9e4075`).
2. **Task 0.2 executed** against `Adamgdwn/the-freedom-engine-os` via GitHub MCP:
   - Branch `cloud/0.2-freedom-framing` created.
   - `AGENTS.md` — CNS Role section sharpened: names 3-layer CNS core explicitly, adds "executive AI business partner" framing, clarifies UI/cockpit/voice surfaces express cognition (not the product).
   - `README.md` — added "Role in the Guided AI Labs CNS" section after Purpose; corrects UI-first reading risk.
   - `docs/architecture.md` — verified already consistent (control-plane / business-partner framing); no change needed.
   - **PR #21 opened** → https://github.com/Adamgdwn/the-freedom-engine-os/pull/21 (status `ready-for-review`).
3. **Dispatch updated** — 0.2 → `ready-for-review`, claimed_by null, pr_url set.
4. **Next task:** 0.3 (GAIL OS Rev 2 deep-brain framing) — available, cloud-safe.

### 2026-06-26 Session 4 — What Was Done

1. **Reviewed requirements doc** (`2026-06-27-agentic-multi-agent-context-compaction-requirements.md`) — identified that prior loop protocol understated compaction as "unavailable to cloud agents." Corrected across all surfaces.
2. **Rewrote compaction section in `docs/loop-protocol.md`** (Chunk Four):
   - "Token Budget and Context Refresh" replaced with "Compaction — The Core Continuity Mechanism"
   - Invariant established: `checkpoint → compact → rehydrate → continue`
   - Target threshold: 100,000 input tokens
   - Runtime-specific mechanisms: ScheduleWakeup (local /loop), auto-compaction (Claude Code web)
   - Safe checkpoint boundary rules defined
   - Trigger signals listed (any one sufficient)
3. **Added Rehydration section** to `docs/loop-protocol.md` — 5-item minimum rehydration set; explicit "do not reload" list
4. **Expanded checkpoint format** in `docs/loop-protocol.md` — added `exact_next_step`, `acceptance_criteria` (met/remaining), `decisions`, `validation`, `required_context_on_resume`, `compaction_count`, `current_phase`
5. **Updated `AGENTS.md` cloud banner** — removed `/compact` from "local-only" list; added explicit statement that compaction is required in all contexts with the `checkpoint → compact → rehydrate → continue` invariant
6. **Commit `514baa8`** — "Chunk Four: compaction-first loop protocol"

**Key decision confirmed (Adam):** "cloud agents must compact is absolutely the answer and the loop inside must compact. That's the key to keeping this running for hours and hours without losing fidelity."

**Session outcome:** Loop infrastructure is now complete. Compaction is the architectural core, not an afterthought. The loop is ready to run.

---

### 2026-06-26 Session 3 — What Was Done

1. **Cloud agent infrastructure created** — 4 new files:
   - `docs/cloud-agent-startup.md` — startup sequence, branch strategy, claim/lock pattern, close-out protocol for cloud context
   - `docs/build-control/cloud-dispatch.yaml` — machine-readable dispatch: 11 available Phase 0 tasks (0.2–0.7f) + Phase 1 tasks with platform tags
   - `docs/build-control/2026-06-26 - phase-0-chunk-specs.md` — detailed chunk specs for all Phase 0 tasks with acceptance criteria, templates, stop conditions
   - `docs/cloud-env-requirements.md` — env var and MCP requirements by phase
2. **AGENTS.md updated** — cloud agent banner added (redirects to cloud-agent-startup.md), Graphify Policy conditionalized, Close-Out Protocol updated (no /compact in cloud)
3. **AI_BOOTSTRAP.md updated** — Graphify Policy conditionalized, Commands section filled in (N/A — coordination repo)
4. **repo-workstream-board.md updated** — Platform column added to Phase 0 and Phase 1 tables (cloud-safe, windows-local, coordinated)
5. **current-build-pathway.md updated** — Chunk One filled in (complete), Chunk Two added (Phase 0 cloud agent runs, planned)

### 2026-06-25 Session 2 — What Was Done

1. **GAIL OS Rev 2 fully read** from GitHub zip — Q1 answered (see below). BLK-001 corrected.
2. **CNS role statements added to all three core repos:**
   - `the-freedom-engine-os/AGENTS.md` — Created (repo had none)
   - `graphify-workspace-cockpit/AGENTS.md` — CNS Role section prepended
   - `gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2/AGENTS.md` — Updated via GitHub MCP (commit cfbff22)
3. **Phase 1 chunk specs written:** `docs/build-control/2026-06-25 - phase-1-chunk-specs.md` — Chunks 20–23 with acceptance criteria, output files, risks
4. **BLK-001 corrected:** OS spine exists in Python; blocker is now "no HTTP API + no JSON Schema contracts"
5. **Architecture clarification recorded:** `@gail/contracts` must be JSON Schema → generated TypeScript (not Python types), because OS is Python and Freedom is TypeScript

---

## What Was Completed This Session

1. **Master architecture ingested.** `guided_ai_labs_agentic_os_cns_master_architecture.md` fully read, parsed, and structured.

2. **All coordination artifacts created** in `docs/build-control/`:
   - [master-plan-summary.md](master-plan-summary.md) — architecture summary, repo inventory, phase plan, Graphify decision
   - [dependency-graph.md](dependency-graph.md) — layer order, cross-repo contracts, blocking dependencies, sync checkpoints
   - [repo-workstream-board.md](repo-workstream-board.md) — per-repo task board, phase-by-phase task list with states
   - [contracts-and-integration-points.md](contracts-and-integration-points.md) — canonical object schemas, event vocabulary, API endpoints, auth model
   - [decisions-log.md](decisions-log.md) — 12 locked decisions including Graphify cross-machine strategy
   - [risks-and-blockers.md](risks-and-blockers.md) — 5 active blockers, 14 risks across architecture / governance / execution / commercial
   - [handoff-state.md](handoff-state.md) — this file

3. **Graphify cross-machine decision made** (DEC-005): Linux cockpit = primary; Windows Enhanced Graphify = extraction node; GitHub = graph sync transport.

4. **Repo inventory confirmed via GitHub MCP:**

| Repo | Platform | CNS Layer | Maturity |
|---|---|---|---|
| `the-freedom-engine-os` | Linux | Freedom | V1 scaffold, Next.js 16 monorepo |
| `gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2` | Windows | GAIL OS | Active, TypeScript monorepo, `apps/`, `packages/`, `data/` |
| `graphify-workspace-cockpit` | Linux primary | Graphify | "Second video ready" — FastAPI + React |
| `ag-operations-m365-foundation` | Windows | M365 Foundation | Stages 1–9 documented, Stage 9 agentic bridge |
| `guided-ai-journey-website-and-tools` | Linux | Sensory — readiness | Active, M365 2-way handshake in progress |
| `oldskoolai.com` | Linux | Sensory — learning | Active |
| `bowtie_risk_program` | Linux | Risk circuit | Active |
| `change-leadership-tools` | Unknown | Change circuit | Private, unknown state |
| `clean-pdf-build` | Linux | EasyDraft Docs | Private |
| `guided-ai-labs-website` | Linux | Front door | Active |

---

## Active Blockers (summary)

- BLK-001: GAIL OS core spine not implemented → blocks Freedom, M365, product apps
- BLK-002: Graphify HTTP API not exposed externally → blocks Freedom context queries
- BLK-003: `@gail/contracts` package doesn't exist → type drift risk
- BLK-004: Windows Enhanced Graphify hasn't extracted Windows repos
- BLK-005: M365 app registration status unknown

---

## Immediate Next Actions (Phase 1 — Ready to Start)

### CP-0 Status: COMPLETE for core repos

| Action | Status | Notes |
|---|---|---|
| CNS role statement — `the-freedom-engine-os` | **Done 2026-06-25** | AGENTS.md created |
| CNS role statement — `gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2` | **Done 2026-06-25** | Via GitHub MCP, commit cfbff22 |
| CNS role statement — `graphify-workspace-cockpit` | **Done 2026-06-25** | Section prepended |
| CNS role statement — product repos | Pending | Medium priority |
| Confirm M365 app registration | Pending | Clears BLK-005 |
| Run Windows Enhanced Graphify extraction | Pending | Clears BLK-004 — depends on Q2 answer |

### Phase 1 — Next agent session (Windows GAIL OS)

Read `docs/build-control/2026-06-25 - phase-1-chunk-specs.md` then start **Chunk 20** in `gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2`:

1. Open `docs/current-build-pathway.md` in GAIL OS Rev 2 — find Chunk Twenty
2. Implement `evidence_writer.py` — approval → EvidencePacket JSON file
3. Extend `local_proof_runner.py` — mission → approval → evidence cycle
4. Run tests: `python -m unittest discover -s tests`
5. Commit + push to `Adamgdwn/gail-ai-operating-system-rev-2`

After Chunk 20 is done → Chunk 21 (FastAPI HTTP layer). After Chunk 21 → this control repo Chunk 22 (`@gail/contracts` JSON Schema).

---

## Key Files to Read on Restart

After a fresh start, context clear, or handoff — read ONLY these:

1. This file (`docs/build-control/handoff-state.md`)
2. `docs/build-control/repo-workstream-board.md` — see current task states
3. `docs/build-control/risks-and-blockers.md` — check for new blockers
4. `git status --short` in this repo

Do NOT load the full master architecture doc again — the summary is in `master-plan-summary.md`.

---

## Platform Notes

- **Linux machine:** Adam's Pop!_OS workstation. Runs: Freedom Engine, Graphify Cockpit, GAI Journey, OldSkoolAI, Bowtie, GAIL website, this control repo.
- **Windows machine:** Runs: GAIL AI OS Rev 2 (canonical OS), AG Operations Workspace (M365 Foundation), Enhanced Graphify.
- **GitHub:** `Adamgdwn` — all repos have GitHub remotes. Primary cross-machine transport.
- **Supabase:** Org `gudzhmrtcbxfvteqtasbgud`. Freedom Supabase project: `basbwglynuyfxcqxfyur`.
- **Direct link:** Windows/Linux Ethernet cable. Last resort. Token-heavy.
- **Master env:** `/home/adamgoodwin/code/.env.master` — never commit.

## Architecture Quick Reference

```
Signal → GAIL OS classifies → Freedom reasons → OS validates authority
       → Motor system executes → Evidence returned to OS
       → Graphify updates → Freedom learns
```

R-levels: R0 (observe) R1 (propose) R2 (internal write) R3 (restricted) R4 (charter-based autonomous) R5 (human-only)
A-levels: A0 (manual) → A6 (future-state minimal governance — NOT current authority)

Three core layers: Freedom (cognition) + GAIL OS (authority/evidence/state) + Graphify (relationship intelligence)

---

## Open Questions

| # | Question | Status | Why it matters |
|---|---|---|---|
| Q1 | GAIL OS Rev 2 implementation state | **ANSWERED 2026-06-25** — Python spine complete through Chunk 19 (A1 local no-network). Apps: command-center (React). Packages: uaos-core (Python). Phase 1 = HTTP API layer. | Phase 1 chunk specs now written. |
| Q2 | Is Enhanced Graphify a separate tool or the cockpit running on Windows? | **Open** | Determines Windows extraction workflow for BLK-004 |
| Q3 | Has M365 app registration been provisioned in Entra? | **Open** | Required before Phase 4 |
| Q4 | Is `change-leadership-tools` on Linux or Windows? What is its current state? | **Open** | Required for Phase 5 sequencing |
| Q5 | What is the target timeline for Phase 1 (GAIL OS HTTP API) completion? | **Open** | Sets pace for Freedom bridge (Chunk 23) |
